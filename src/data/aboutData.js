    description1: "Hey there! I’m Bansi Parmar, a React.js Developer with 2 years of experience crafting seamless, interactive, and visually engaging web experiences.",
    // description2: "I am a student at KSSBM&IT, currently working as ReactJs Developer. A project that I worked on towards the end of my Master’s in History set me on this path of a web developer. The project involved looking at movies on historical themes that could be considered as an educational tool. The website was not the focus of the project, but working on it was such a thrilling experience that a career in this felt like a right fit. Other than this I am a bibliophile, who not just loves reading books but also buying and maintaining a personal library.",

description2:"What started as a small spark of curiosity for building websites quickly turned into a passion for bringing ideas to life through clean code and creative design. I love blending logic with aesthetics — turning complex concepts into smooth, user-friendly interfaces. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me lost in a good book or expanding my personal library — a space that fuels both my imagination and attention to detail"
